As with #94, please make sure you're on the latest version. If that doesn't fix the issue, please look in app/controllers/application_controller.rb and comment out all lines in handle_fhir_errors exceptfor theyield`. This should suppress the error handling and give you the full stack trace. I suspect it is the same issue, but this will help to confirm.
